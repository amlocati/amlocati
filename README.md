# ðŸš€About Me! 
## Introduction
My name is Alexis Locati, and I am an undergraduate studying Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University. At Iowa State University, I have been involved in developing an Attitude Determination and Control Systems test bed as well as developing a 3U cube satellite designed to be flown in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to measure Earth's soil moisture. Beyond Iowa State University, I interned at Orbion Space Technology, where I helped develop spacecraft panels that integrate an ion-thruster as well as testing equipment. Following my degree, I aspire to develop spacecraft, specifically interplanetary satellites and deep space probes for the purpose of exploration. 
## Learning Interests
Currently, I am interested in learning aerospace applications of Python and C, specifically spacecraft applications. This interest is supported by my current enrollment in an advanced programming and computational tools course. I hope to apply this knowledge to developing advanced spacecraft systems. 
## Current Projects
I am currently the project manager for CySAT, Iowa State University's cube satellite development team. The team utilizes GitHub for all things software development, which is the current prime focus of the project. Most of the programming is written in C, including programming for our Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS), On-Board Computer (OBC), and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) board. For the other systems, Python is used for programming; this includes the payload radiometer and ground station.
## Hobbies
I enjoy working with Arduinos for side projects, such as developing a star tracker for my telescope and other small space applications. On a different note, I enjoy watching science fiction movies and TV shows such as Lost in Space on Netflix and Rick and Morty on Adult Swim. I tend to get fun ideas from watching science fiction that tend to lend themselves into my projects. 

Thanks for stopping by!
